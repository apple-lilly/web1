  <h1>Reputation</h1>
  <img src="tay.jpg" width="500">
  <p>Reputation is the sixth studio album by Taylor Swift. The record was primarily produced by Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback and Swift herself,
  who also serves as the executive producer. Described by Swift as her "most cathartic album", the album is influenced by Swift's highly publicized personal life and disputes.
  The album's sound features a darker and heavier tone compared to Swift's previous projects, delving into her vulnerable side.
  Musically, it is a pop, electropop and synth-pop record that contains influences of hip hop, EDM, trap and tropical house.
  this album released after she had been through hard time due to nasty scandle with Kardashian family. but she've made it to shake it all off and work on her music and
  succeed in her new album.</p>
